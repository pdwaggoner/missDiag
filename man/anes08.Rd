The survey dataset includes 11 variables from the
2008 edition of the American National Election Study.
}
\details{
The dataset \code{anes} was prepared by Kropko et al. (2014). The nine
variables contain different levels of missingness.

The dataset was imputed using random value imputation and predictive
mean matching via \code{\link[mice:mice]{mice::mice()}} (Version: 3.13.0, seed=42).

The imputed datasets are available in \code{anes_rng} (random value
imputation) and \code{anes_pmm} (predictive mean matching).
